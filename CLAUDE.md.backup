# Claude Code - Session Strategy

Best practices for efficient context management and productive sessions.

## Progressive Loading Principle

**Load only what you need, when you need it.**

### Always Load (Startup)
- Session state files (~1k tokens)
- Summary/quick files (.quick.md, README.md headers)
- Current task context only

### Load On-Demand
- Full documentation (when modifying)
- Detailed specs (when implementing)
- Historical context (when researching)

**Rule**: Reference via `@filename.md` instead of reading upfront.

## Context Budget Guidelines

| Session Type | Target | Strategy |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| Quick fix | <25% | Minimal: load only affected files |
| Feature work | <50% | Progressive: load as you go |
| Research | <60% | Selective: specific docs only |
| Architecture | <70% | Planned: /compact every 40 messages |

## Session Workflow

### Starting
1. Use existing context from previous session
2. Load task-specific files only
3. Don't read entire README/docs upfront

### Working
- Monitor context meter
- `/compact` at 70% capacity
- Use subagents for isolated tasks
- Clear between unrelated tasks

### Ending
- Save decisions to relevant docs
- Commit with descriptive messages
- Update roadmap/status files

## Key Commands

- `/compact` - Summarize and free context (use at 70%)
- `/clear` - Full reset (only when switching major tasks)
- `/context` - Check current context usage

## Tool Efficiency

**DO** ✅:
- Use `@` references for specific files
- Load summaries before full docs
- Trust file paths without reading first
- Use Grep/Glob for discovery, Read for details

**DON'T** ❌:
- Load all docs at session start
- Read files you won't modify
- Keep unused context loaded
- Let context exceed 80%

## Commit Conventions

```
{type}: {brief description}

{detailed explanation if needed}

**This file is loaded automatically on every Claude Code session.**
**Keep it under 1k tokens. Add project-specific context to project CLAUDE.md files.**

## Contextual Suggestions

### Suggest `/reflect` When:
- User expresses frustration ("this is frustrating", "stuck", "annoying")
- Major achievement completed (complex feature, bug fixed, milestone)
- Long session (>2 hours) without reflection
- User mentions feeling tired/drained

**How to suggest**: Brief, natural mention like:
- "Great progress! Want to capture a quick reflection? (`/reflect`)"
- "That was frustrating. Mind logging how you're feeling? (`/reflect`)"

Keep it subtle - don't interrupt flow. Skip if user seems rushed.
